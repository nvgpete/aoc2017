Balancing a tower of programs

I didn't fully solve the problem in code as it was somewhat messy to figure
out which program weight was off, especially if it had been in a node with
two branches. (Which my problem set did not do.) It was relatively simple to
print out the weights of the first (and subsequent, in case of 2 branch
nodes) misweighted node and figure out what it should have been. Much easier
than writing code to do it.
