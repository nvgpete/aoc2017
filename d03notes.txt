Accessing and testing spiral memory

There is no d03.txt data file as the input is '277678' which is embedded in
a #define statement in the program.

I did part A by noting that as you move down and right from the origin the
values are perfect squares of odd numbers whose distance from the center is
just the odd number minus 1. The closest odd square to my input was 527^2 =
277729 at a distance of 526. Subtracting I get that I have to move left 51
squares, which moves me 51 squares closer to the origin. Thus the answer is
526-51=475.  

Since the second part required that I write a program to generate the spiral
locations in order, I also wrote it for the first part so there is both a
d03a.c and d03b.c.
