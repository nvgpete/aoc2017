GPU overloaded by too many particles

Part a was doable by inspection with a little physics. Using 
grep -n 0,0,1 d20.txt
grep -n 0,0,-1 d20.txt
and a few others I determined the smallest Manhattan accelerations were
particle 21 and 457. All other particles had larger accelerations and would
get away faster. Particle 457 had a smaller initial velocity so I chose it,
figuring even if I guessed wrong I could wait a minute and gues particle 21.

I did write a program for the second part, arbitrarily stepping 1000 times,
and hoping that was enough. After 39 steps there were no more collisions.
I did a similar thing to do part A programatically, and it settled on
particle 457 after about 300 iterations.
