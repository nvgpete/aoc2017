Check that pass phrases follow certain odd rules.

Very often I suspect if I was better with grep I could solve these as a
one-liner. Sometimes I even make a few tries before giving up in abject
failure. This time, however, the following worked.

grep -vc "\(\<[a-z]*\>\).*\1" d04.txt

(Probably a one of a kind miracle...)
