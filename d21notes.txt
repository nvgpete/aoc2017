Generating 2D fractal art.

The general idea is to represent the 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 subimages as integers
with 1 bits for '#'. Then we can make a couple of lookup tables, one going
from 2x2 -> 3x3 and the other from 3x3 -> 4x4 by reading theinput data. Thus
we have
int xlat23[16]; // range 0..511 (9 bits)
int xlat34[512]; // range 0..65535 (16 bits)
Each line in the input date for 2x2 -> 3x3 corresponds to as many as 4 table
entries once I account for rotations. Similarly in the 3x3 -> 4x4 case there
may 8 be entries, 4 rotations times 2 flips.

When I got all this coded, I realized I had done bits like

3 2  and 8 7 6 and 15 14 13 12 
1 0      5 4 3     11 10  9  8
         2 1 0      7  6  5  4
                    3  2  1  0

for reading the input data and in the opposite order in reading the data
from the image array. Fortunately this has no effect on the indexes since the
two representations are rotations/flips of each other. However, thevalues in
the arrays need to be read out backwards; there are two statements with
comments where I made that adjustment.

The second part was just more iterations. I was concerned that it might be
that I needed to rotate the output data along with the indexes which would
have forced me to number pixels in a more consistent manner.
